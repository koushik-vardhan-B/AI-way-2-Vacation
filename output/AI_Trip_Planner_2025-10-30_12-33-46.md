    ### Trip Plan to Kedarnath for 2 Members with a Budget of ‚Çπ10,000 per Head for 6 Days

Given the budget constraint of ‚Çπ10,000 per head for 6 days, we'll have to plan carefully to ensure a memorable and comfortable trip to Kedarnath for 2 members. Here's a breakdown of estimated costs and suggestions for accommodation, food, transportation, and activities:

#### Transportation:
- **To and From:** The nearest airport is Jolly Grant Airport in Dehradun, and the nearest railway station is in Haridwar. From there, you can take a taxi or bus to Gaurikund, the starting point of the Kedarnath trek. 
  - Taxi (Dehradun to Gaurikund): ‚Çπ5,000 - ‚Çπ6,000 (one way)
  - Bus (Haridwar to Gaurikund): ‚Çπ200 - ‚Çπ500 (one way)
- **Local:** Once in Gaurikund, you'll need to trek to Kedarnath. Pony, palanquin, or helicopter services are available for those who cannot trek.
  - Pony: ‚Çπ2,000 - ‚Çπ3,000 (one way)
  - Palanquin: ‚Çπ5,000 - ‚Çπ6,000 (one way)
  - Helicopter: ‚Çπ7,000 - ‚Çπ8,000 (one way, depending on the service provider)

#### Accommodation:
- **Gaurikund:** Budget hotels and lodges are available, with prices starting from ‚Çπ800 - ‚Çπ1,200 per night for a double room.
- **Kedarnath:** GMVN (Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam) rest houses and budget hotels are available. Prices start from ‚Çπ600 - ‚Çπ1,000 per night for a double room.

#### Food:
- **Gaurikund and Kedarnath:** Basic vegetarian meals are available at dhabas and restaurants, with prices ranging from ‚Çπ100 - ‚Çπ200 per meal per person.

#### Activities:
- **Trekking:** The main activity is trekking from Gaurikund to Kedarnath, which is free but may require hiring a pony or taking a helicopter for those who cannot trek.
- **Darshan at Kedarnath Temple:** Free, but you may need to pay for special darshan or services.

#### Budget Breakdown (Estimated):
- Transportation: ‚Çπ10,000 - ‚Çπ14,000 (for both, including to and from, and local)
- Accommodation (5 nights): ‚Çπ4,000 - ‚Çπ6,000 (avg. ‚Çπ800 - ‚Çπ1,200 per night for a double room)
- Food (for 6 days): ‚Çπ6,000 - ‚Çπ8,000 (avg. ‚Çπ500 - ‚Çπ667 per day for two people)
- Activities and Miscellaneous: ‚Çπ2,000 - ‚Çπ3,000

Total Estimated Cost for 2 People for 6 Days: ‚Çπ22,000 - ‚Çπ31,000

Given your budget of ‚Çπ20,000 for 2 people (‚Çπ10,000 per head), it seems there might be a slight mismatch in the estimated costs and your allocated budget. To fit within your budget, consider the following adjustments:
- Opt for more budget-friendly accommodation options.
- Plan your meals carefully, opting for more economical choices.
- Consider trekking instead of hiring ponies or taking helicopters for a significant cost reduction.
- Look for package deals that include transportation, accommodation, and food for a more streamlined and potentially cost-effective option.

Please let me know if there are any specific preferences or changes in your travel plans that might help in adjusting the budget more accurately.
