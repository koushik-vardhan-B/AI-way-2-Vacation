    To plan a 4-day trip to Kedarnath under 5000, here's a rough estimate of the costs:
* Transportation: 
  - Train/Bus fare from your location to Haridwar/Rishikesh: 1000 - 2000
  - Taxi/Bus fare from Haridwar/Rishikesh to Gaurikund: 500 - 1000
  - Helicopter fare from Gaurikund to Kedarnath (optional): 3000 - 4000
* Accommodation: 
  - Hotel/Guesthouse in Kedarnath: 500 - 1000 per night
  - Total for 3 nights: 1500 - 3000
* Food: 
  - Meals and snacks for 4 days: 1000 - 2000
* Activities: 
  - Kedarnath Temple visit: free
  - Other activities like trekking, sightseeing: 500 - 1000
* Total estimated cost for the trip: 3500 - 5000

Please note that these are rough estimates and actual costs may vary depending on your location, mode of transportation, accommodation choices, and other factors.

To get a more accurate estimate, I would need to know more details about your trip, such as:
* Your starting location
* Your preferred mode of transportation
* Your accommodation preferences
* Any specific activities or sights you want to include in your trip

Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
